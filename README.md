# An-Intelligent-Othello

This is a project from an AI class I took while attending LA Tech. In the 2 weeks I had to complete this project I created the game Othello and programmed an AI to play against. The AI uses the Mini-Max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. I created Othello using the TKinter python library.

# How-to-Run

You just need to run the othello program normally in the same directory as the pictures folder.
